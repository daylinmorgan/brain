Aside from this `brain` which is a public static site.
I thought it might be useful to have a wiki that houses important *private* information.

Possible Contents:

  - information about living situation
    - insurance, mortgage
    - paints
    - repairs needed/completed

  - log of information possibly useful to me/family at any point in the future

  - instructions in the event of my sudden demise/incapacitation

  - knowledge I want to preserve but don't want in my public brain

## Features I want

- possible to edit flat files
  - scp files
  - git-backend

- embed or attach rich media (documents/images/videos)

- customizability
  - integrations
  - theming

## Options

### [PmWiki](https://www.pmwiki.org/)

It was kinda slow even just trying to use its own website.

### [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)

### [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/)

### [OtterWiki](https://otterwiki.com)

### [Docuwiki](https://dokuwiki.org)

Briefly had this running but did was not a fan of the workflow to edit static files.

## OtterWiki

For now I have an active wiki that is essentially unused...
But it has the following features which make it attractive to me:

- git-backend, I can clone locally edit and push changes
- markdown-based, I don't write wiki's so this syntax has less friction
- written in python, I can't reason about things happening in php/js as easily but this leaves a simpler door for future extensibility, if I want to contribute upstream
