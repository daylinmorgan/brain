# Book: The Blacktongue Thief

Review: 4.5/5 stars

I initially started this book thinking it was part of a complete trilogy.
Unfortunately this is not the case!
But the only unfortunate part is I'll need to wait to read more.

This book was a lot what I guess one might call "high fantasy" than what I've read lately.
It featured lots of world-building and slowly trickled information about it's magic system and political intrigue.
I struggled some to finish it but I was never disappointed when I did come back to it.
Ultimately, it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger with the MC getting a much needed power-up.
I'm excited to see how the story evolves from here.
