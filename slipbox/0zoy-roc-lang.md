Some general thoughts I have while exploring the Roc [programming language](6rgi-programming-languages.md).

Tag unions are very interesting as a concept and I need to use them more.

Roc could actually be a really cool scripting language in the future.
Especially if they keep the super straightforward dependency specification.
