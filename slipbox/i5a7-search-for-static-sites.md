# Search for Static Sites

It should be possible to implement a basic search feature for Hugo or any static site using something like [lunr](https://victoria.dev/blog/add-search-to-hugo-static-sites-with-lunr/).

This should be possible to implement within a theme without the user's intervention.

I'll try to implement this in my `brain-stem` `hugo` theme so my own brain is easier to search.
