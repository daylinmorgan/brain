A start page is the first page you see when starting a browser.
It can be nice to have a custom UI with frequently used links.

Start pages I've used in the past:

- [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm)
- [Yet another generic startpage](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage)
- [Excalith](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page)
