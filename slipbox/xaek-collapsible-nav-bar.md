# Collapsible Nav Bar

In two separate `hugo` projects I've managed to use a collapsing nav bar.
I should really document for myself the basic pieces that make it work.

Something that complicates comparing my versions to others is that one
uses `windicss` and another uses `unocss`,
which are both a little more slim on community documentation.
