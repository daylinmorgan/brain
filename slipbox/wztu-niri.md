## Current Limitations vs Hyprland

- A lack of keybind submaps (https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/issues/846).
- xwayland support is not buitlin, but possible using xwayland-satellite

I want to write a custom window picker for use with rofi that has workspace/monitor info.
Could integrate this into [niriman](https://git.dayl.in/daylin/niriman) so I can get the info with the same IPC functions.
