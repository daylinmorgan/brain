# Fediverse

A term used to describe decentralized services formally own, operated, and controlled by corporations.

People envision these technologies as free from some of the effects pursuant
to large companies like Facebook and Twitter and incentives for how these companies operate.

## Federated Services of Interest to Me

### Lemmy

[homepage](https://join-lemmy.org/)

A social link aggregator akin to reddit.com 
I host my own at [lemmy.dayl.in](https://lemmy.dayl.in), since reddit's API changes I have exclusively used lemmy.


### Bookwyrm

[homepage](https://joinbookwyrm.com/)

A book tracking social platform akin to goodreads.
Currently, I use goodreads to along with this "second brain" to track [books](bfs0-books.md), but this might be an interesting alternative.


### GotoSocial
[homepage](https://gotosocial.org)

A barebones ActivityPub server that might work well as an alternative to self hosting a Mastodon instance. Requires the use of separate front-ends, this separation may mean a lower resource cost. 


### Mastodon

[homepage](https://mastodon.social/)

A microblogging service akin to twitter.
Seems difficult to self-host and I have choice anxiety about signing up for a server hosted by someone else.
