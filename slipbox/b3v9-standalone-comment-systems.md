title: Standalone Comment Systems

I toy around a lot with the idea of having a blog.
My main motivation is giving back to the community.
Over the years finding answers to niche problems has come in the form of blog posts.
This `brain` obviously serving as an intentionally organic unorganized web of knowledge,
fails to capture some of the same discovery and value to others as a typical blog might.

One possibly useful component to a good blog is a robust commenting system
that allows the community to engage both with the author and the wider audience.

This is a list I'll come back to if I ever do decide to engage in more (semi-)formal writing.

Some important criteria:

- Hosted (Pricing)
- Integration
- Authentication
- Interface

To evaluate:

- [Disqus](https://disqus.com)
- [Giscus](https://giscus.app)
- Mastodon [custom implementation](https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/29/adding-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-mastodon/)
- [R3ply](https://r3ply.com) *not available yet*
