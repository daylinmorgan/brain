Order below is determined more by order of introduction than preference or familiarity.

## R

A good language for data analysis and visualization tasks, but the syntax/underlying system isn't to my taste.

## Python

Ol'reliable, python is the language I can pick up and implement the logic I need relatively painlessly.
Having spent a lot of time with it I'm used to the quirks of distributing and packaging an interpreted language, or else I wouldn't have made my own python packaging tool [viv](https://viv.dayl.in).
Most of my python uses cases aren't particularly hampered by it's primary criticism that being "speed".

## Bash

I spent more time getting up to speed with python before I resorted to bash as a scripting language.
Ultimately, the best part of bash is the simple command execution through pipes, job control, and process substitution.
In addition, bash + GNU coreutils will always be ready and waiting on any system I find myself in.

## Lua

## Go

## Nim

Felt like coming back to an old friend, warts and all.

## Nix
 
## Rust

## Zig

## Roc

## Nushell
