Some tips and tricks for myself to use Gmail.

## Gmail Permalink

I have several gmail accounts and the "inbox" url shifts according to the order in which they were authenticated i.e. the `1` in this url shifts:
`https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox`.

In order to create stable links (like for a usable bookmark) you need to use a url of the form:

```
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/?authuser=user@gmail.com
```

This link will direct to the correct inbox. Hopefully this option never goes away on Google's end.

## Search

Gmail has a number of [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en&ref_topic=3394593&sjid=2040408358466082132-NC)
which can be used to filter emails.
