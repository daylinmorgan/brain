# Nim libraries I want

Here is a list in no particular order of `nim` libraries that I wish existed or might write one day.

## bbansi

A simple library to convert `bbcode` markup to `ANSI` escape code formatted text.
Coming from `python` I'm spoiled by the [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library that makes this easy.

I've started work (see [repo](https://github.com/daylinmorgan/bbansi)) on this library that has been employed in nearly any `nim`-based CLI I write.

## mdansi

A library (that would depend on `bbansi`, and `markdown`) to convert markdown documents
to `ANSI` escape code formatted text.

## usu

A library to parse my custom config language [`usu`](https://github.com/usu-dev).
