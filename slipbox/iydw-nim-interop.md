# Nim Interop

Nim has the powerful ability to interop with code from any of it's backends.
Notably this is something I made need to eventually fill in the gaps of
third-party `nim` libraries with legacy c/c++ libraries.

Additionally there is library support for python via [`nimpy`](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy)
