[Jujutsu](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj) is a git-compatible vcs, it's got some interesting ideas and I plan to play around with it in some of my low stakes projects where git history is simple, such as this very repo!


I found after spending 30 or so minutes squashing, describing, and pushing that `jj` had flooded my `git` history with a bunch of commits that lead nowhere. I suppose this isn't much a problem but if I fall back to a `git log --all` there is a lot of noise.
