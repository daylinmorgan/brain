## Tips

### Reset item in dmenu frequency sorting

I of the main ways I use rofi is as an app launcher.
Sometimes I switch the primary application I use for instance switching to Firefox while keeping Chrome installed.
To prevent muscle memory from opening the main app I launch from Rofi I need to reset's its ranking in the `+dmenu` rofi interface.

A simple way to do this is to open rofi place the selector on the item and use `Shift + Delete`.
