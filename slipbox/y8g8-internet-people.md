This one is a little odd but I see a lot of people in the same niches.
Sometimes surprising niches and it can be hard to remember where
I recognized a particular online username (usually github) from
and what interesting work they've done.
This is a non-exhaustive list of people I see all the time and
forget the primary niche or technology I know them from.
