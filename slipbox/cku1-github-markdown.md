The official syntax of these [changed](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-new-markdown-extension-alerts-provide-distinctive-styling-for-significant-content/):

```
> [!NOTE]
> This is a note
```

It's possible to add unique [admonition like](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925) outputs in markdown on `github.com`

e.g.:

```
> **Note**
> This is a note

> **Warning**
> This is a note
```
