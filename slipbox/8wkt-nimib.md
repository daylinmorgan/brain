[Nimib] and its mdBook rewrite [Nimibook] offer an interesting opportunity to generate documentation written with `nim`.

Similar to the concept of `runnableExamples` in `nim`, this helps keep code examples up to date.
Since, if either a compiler change or library change breaks code it will also break the documentation.

I plan to utilize nimibook to port over [nim-by-example](https://nim-by-example.github.io).
