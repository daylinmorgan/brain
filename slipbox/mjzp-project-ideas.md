Frequently, I think up problems I'd like solved (either by myself) or someone else.
This is a collection of ideas for things that I think would be either interesting to work on or helpful for my own workflow.

## llm-tui

I use [llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) more than I thought I would and I sometimes wish I had a tui for the chat interface.
I think with something like [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) and the plugin api of llm, this would be pretty doable to implement in a few days.

### features

- input box
- response box (with optional markdown rendering)
- model selector
- existing conversation selector
