`Zk-nvim` is a neovim plugin that makes thinking (writing in this *brain*) much more fluid.
Best of all like the parent app it relies on customization is considered out-of-the box.

So it's possible to extend it's functionality with [lua](cnes-lua-function.md).

**TODO**:

- Modify zk-nvim so when I use it's commands telescope offers a pager view.
    - Currently, it only displays titles which might be a default for telescope.
    - Titles are nice but text previews would be helpful
