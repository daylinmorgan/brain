title: My Brain
tags: [meta]

Many folks describe their zettelkasten or digital garden as a second brain.
For myself, in many ways this "brain" is not so much a *second* brain as it is an extension or improvement on my current brain.
Maybe more accurately described as a brain*dump*.
I'm incredibly forgetful around concepts and ideas that I don't spend my day to day thinking about.
I want this resource to both form new ideas and recapture old ideas, ever improving and evolving with age, like a good cheese.

For now you can start at [tags](/tags) and let the links take you.
For more info on how I manage this brain*dump* check the [meta tag](/tags/meta).
