See below for current and past subdomains I've associated with my personal domain at [dayl.in](https://dayl.in)

## Current

### [brain](https://brain.dayl.in)

This very [site](e09h-my-brain.md) built with [hugo](3nx1-building-my-brain-w-hugo.md).

### [git](https://git.dayl.in)

My very own git forge powered by [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/).

### [gh](https://gh.dayl.in)

This subdomain is a redirect to my user GitHub Pages instance at `daylinmorgan.github.io`.
This allows me to take advantage of the project pages feature that redirects urls.
While still listing using custom domain.
For example I don't have a dedicated url for `task.mk` and instead point users to [gh.dayl.in/task.mk](https://gh.dayl.in/task.mk)

### [viv](https://viv.dayl.in)

This site is hosted on GitHub which serves to provide a link to both documentation and a shorter link to the curl-able version of `viv`: `curl -fsSL viv.dayl.in/viv.py`.

### [logo](https://logo.dayl.in)

Just a publicly accessible link if I need it for the programmatically generated logo I use.

### [lemmy](https://lemmy.dayl.in)

[Fediverse](xs06-fediverse.md)-based alternative to reddit.

### [gts](https://gts.dayl.in)

[Fediverse](xs06-fediverse.md)-based alternative to twitter.
Specifically used to interact with Mastodon, while being dead simple to setup and host.

### [nimpkgs](https://nimpkgs.dayl.in)

A `karax`-powered SPA as an alternative to [nimble.directory](https://nimble.directory).
Unlike `nimble.directory` which has been neglected and is regularly inaccessible,
this site is completely static and auto-generated using GitHub Actions.
It loses package README's, but gains individual package version information from git tags.

### [recipes](https://recipes.dayl.in)

Simple recipebook website.

### [attic](https://attic.dayl.in)

Attic binary cache for `nix`.

### links

[Linkding](https://linkding.link/) powered bookmark service.

### [bsky](https://bsky.dayl.in)

Revived and active. Follow [me](https://bsky.app/profile/dayl.in) on bluesky!

## Past

### f1

Was a shiny-python app that generated a dashboard for each F1 race.

### start

A custom [start page](2vvb-start-pages.md), I may reactivate this one in the future now that I am back to a surfingkeys heavy browsing experience.
