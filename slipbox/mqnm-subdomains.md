See below for current and past subdomains I've associated with my personal domain at [dayl.in](https://dayl.in)

## Current

### [brain](https://brain.dayl.in)

This very [site](e09h-my-brain.md) built with [hugo](3nx1-building-my-brain-w-hugo.md).

### [git](https://git.dayl.in)

My very own git forge powered by [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/).

### [gh](https://gh.dayl.in)

This subdomain is a redirect to my user GitHub Pages instance at `daylinmorgan.github.io`.
This allows me to take advantage of the project pages feature that redirects urls.
While still listing my custom domain.

### [viv](https://viv.dayl.in)

This site is hosted on GitHub which serves to provide a link to both documentation and a shorter link to the curl-able version of `viv`: `curl -fsSL viv.dayl.in/viv.py`.

### [lemmy](https://lemmy.dayl.in)

[Fediverse](xs06-fediverse.md)-based alternative to reddit.

### [gts](https://gts.dayl.in)

[Fediverse](xs06-fediverse.md)-based alternative to twitter.
Specifically used to interact with Mastodon, while being dead simple to setup and host.

### [nimpkgs](https://nimpkgs.dayl.in)

An `karax`-powered SPA as an alternative to [nimble.directory](https://nimble.directory) which has been neglected and is regularly inaccessible.

It loses package README's, but gains individual package version information from git tags.

### [recipes](https://recipes.dayl.in)

Simple recipe-book website.

### [bsky](https://bsky.dayl.in)

Experiment hosting a PDS for bluesky. 
Got it setup but in the end bluesky probably won't take off so I'll eventually delete it.

## Past

### f1

Was a shiny-python app that generated a dashboard for each F1 race.

### start

A custom [start page](2vvb-start-pages.md), I may reactivate this one in the future now that I am back to a surfingkeys heavy browsing experience.
