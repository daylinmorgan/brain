[Color gradient by value example](https://gist.github.com/nbremer/eb0d1fd4118b731d069e2ff98dfadc47)

I ended up I think using a much simpler approach the [graph](/graph) since I basically wanted to transition from only two colors.

Really though, I've only been able to use `d3` with the help of chatgpt.
